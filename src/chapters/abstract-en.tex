Voice assistant technology is growing rapidly now. Its use has begun to spread to daily use. However, voice assistants are still limited to the use of standard conversation languages. Meanwhile, Indonesian people are accustomed to saying non-standard language in everyday conversation. The execution of this Final Project includes solutions to overcome the problem of voice assistants with non-formal words or not included in the formal word dictionary. The approach used as a solution is to normalize the text using Levenshtein distance.
